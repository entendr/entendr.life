living with intentionality. :br :highlight{class="font-bold"}[entendr.]
::

People who experience anxiety have to be very intentional with their time.

But&mdash;_**what does that mean?**_  

For me, it means fastidiously planning out my day,
keeping inventory, and sticking to considered routines.
Often, this means tedious, repetitive work.

:highlight[entendr.] is my attempt to document, design, and build around
these frameworks for an easier life for myself.
Hopefully, for others too.

Loop back in a few weeks to see how it is going,
or [reach out to me][contact] if you'd like to chat.
