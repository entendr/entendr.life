living with intentionality. :br :highlight{class="font-bold"}[entendr.]
::

People who experience anxiety have to be very intentional with their time.
But&mdash;_**what does that mean?**_
For me, it means fastidiously planning out my day,
keeping inventory, and sticking to considered routines.
Often, this means tedious, repetitive work.

:highlight[entendr.] is my attempt to reimagine
how I do such things, better. For myself.
Hopefully, for others too.

I'm working on a few ideas.
