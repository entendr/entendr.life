I have had crippling anxiety for a long time, and
I've noticed that some of my friends share similar reflexes.<br>

But&mdash;what does it mean to have anxiety?
How does one live with it?
I have tiny frameworks that help me;
keeping a daily journal,
planning out my days by the minute, etc.

I find such fastidiousness exhausting.<br>
<span class="text-red-500">entendr.</span>
is my attempt to document, design, and build around
these frameworks for an easier life for myself.
Hopefully, for others too.

Loop back in a few weeks to see how it is going,
or [reach out to me][contact] if you'd like to chat.
