living with intentionality. :br :highlight{class="font-bold"}[entendr.]
::

People who experience anxiety have to be very intentional with their time.

This means fastidiously planning out their day,
establishing routines, and keeping inventory.  
But this also means tedious and repetitive work
planning and journaling.
Wouldn't it be great to not have to do all such work manually?

:highlight[entendr.]{class="font-bold"} reimagines
such workflows.

**We'll be launching the first product early 2024.  
More to come soon.**
