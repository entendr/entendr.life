# Bureaucracy

> How hard could it be, to create an ordered list?

Data-driven behavior change is hard.
You can easily establish a framework
for planning their way through life and positively
reinforcing useful signals, but it
requires discipline and consistent work
to follow through.

There are hundreds of products that offer to help,
from scheduling apps such as [Motion][motion]
to journaling apps such as [Tana][tana], [Obsidian][obsidian], and [Notion][notion],
and others.
[The most profound technologies are those that disappear][profound-technologies],
yet these require tens, even hundreds of hours
in set-up and maintenance.

The less you would spend worrying about getting your stuff done,
the more you would spend _not doing_ your stuff, it would seem.
