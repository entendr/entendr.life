# Systems, Not Goals

I've grappled with crippling anxiety for as far as I remember.
I would get around `.3` as much work done.
I don't procrastinate, but I get anxious about the work I have to do,
whether I will be able to complete it in time and to standard,
and other non-issues.

This was not a problem when I could comfortably finish my work
anyway. But I find myself with more work lately than I am used to,
and I'm realizing that I need a sustainable way to organize and prioritize effectively
and efficiently
