# Everything, Everywhere

> So, what are you anxious about?

Do you ever feel like there's too much to do?

![everything, everywhere](images/blog/everything-everywhere.jpg)

If you're like me, you probably struggle explaining
the cause of your existential dread.
But you cannot ignore the competing thoughts, tasks,
and expectations clamoring for your attention;
the need to be more, do more, achieve more.
It's almost nothing, but it sure isn't.

This can feel overwhelming.
We should be more present,
more mindful, and more in tune with ourselves and our needs.
