# Idea &rarr; Domain

This idea started as an idea for a more unified and intuitive experience
that does not take hours to set up and maintain.
It should help get your things done more effectively,
and to do that:

- It needs to offer a useful repertoire of features that simplify
  the productivity process.
- It needs to get out of your way, so you can do your stuff.

Then came one of the biggest problem in computer science:
[naming things][naming-things].
:highlight[entendr.] was adapted from _entendre_, which means "to hear/understand."
Our lives generate a continuous stream of signal,
and we must be willing to attend to it, to understand it.
